# Setup - for Posts.js
- We got the structure in place.
- This file is using post.js, so `import post.js from ./Post/Post.js`.
  - Remember to add Code to `Post.js`
  - [Click here](Post/1-Post.md), and then continue.
- Add Fragments to the start and end, since we are returing multiple things at once. 
  - Fragments are `<>  </>`
- Now we can add multiple `Post` in `Posts.js`
<br/><br/>

# Next
- Now since we imported `Post` component we need to go back to App.js and add import statements for `Posts` and `Form` so we don't get errors while compiling. 
- So back to [App.js](../../1-Client.md)
